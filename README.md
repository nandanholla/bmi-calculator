# BMI Calculator

Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.

It is a simple React BMI Calculator app which takes height(cm) and weight(kg) of a person and returns BMI of that person.
